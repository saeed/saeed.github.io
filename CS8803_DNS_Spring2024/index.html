                    <p> Datacenters are the infrastructure that supports most modern applications. In this course, we will cover many aspects of datacenter operations from applications and their performance requirements, to systems, protocols, and hardware that deliver such performance. We will also explore the different systems needed to allow for sharing resources of such large-scale infrastructure.</p>

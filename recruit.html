            <p>Thank you for your interest in working with me and joining the amazing group of <a href="https://nrg.cc.gatech.edu">people working on networks problems at Georgia Tech.</a> I hope you find this page helpful. If you have any further questions after reading this page, feel free to email me.</p>


            <h3>Postdocs</h3>

            <p> As my group grows, I have an openning for a postdoc position. A postdoc working with me will get a lot of freedom picking problems they'd like to explore. They will also contribute to fund raising and mentoring efforts already going on in the group. Another major perk of joining Georgia Tech as a postdoc is becoming a part of <a href="https://nrg.cc.gatech.edu/">NRG</a>, interacting with eleven faculty whose interests cover all areas of networking research. If you are interested, please send me an email.</p>

            <h3>PhD applicants</h3>

            <p> I have multiple openings for PhD students starting in Fall 2024 to tackle problems along two tracks:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalable end host stacks:</strong> In this track, students can choose to work on problems in scaling QUIC/web servers, edge computing, and software/hardware co-design of the network stack, ML inference acceleration, and overload control. Research in this direction requires experience with system building, which students will learn during the course of the program. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Verification of the performance of resource allocation heuristics:</strong> In this track, students can choose to work on problems in modeling datacenter network/compute schedulers, OS resource management algorithms, and IoT systems. Using formal methods, developed models can be used to analytically prove properties of studied systems. Research in this area can also include customization and optimization of verifiers for the developer models. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Satellite netowkring:</strong> In this track, students can choose to work on problems in the measurement, modeling, and protocol tuning for Low Earth Orbit satellite netowkrs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Do you have openings in your lab for Fall 2024 applicants?</strong><br/>
                    Yes, I have multiple openings for PhD students.</p>
                    </li>
                   
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>How do I apply?</strong><br/>
                    Go to <a href="https://gradapp.gatech.edu/apply/">the graduate admission application page</a>. Apply to the PhD in Computer Science - On Campus (School of Computer Science). If you are interested in working with me, please mention my name in your statement of purpose. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>How will I be funded?</strong><br/>
                    In the vast majority of cases, students are continuously funded through a Graduate Research Assistantship or a Graduate Teaching Assistantship. Funding covers tuition waiver and a monthly stipend.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>What are my chances of getting admitted?</strong><br/>
                    I cannot comment on your chances but if your interests/skillset match either of the two broad directions listed above, I strongly encourage you to apply.</p>

            <h3>Master's and Undergrad Students</h3>

            <p><strong>If you are already admitted to Georgia Tech:</strong> Please checkout  <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~amsmti3/projects.html">my project's page</a>. I will be happy to work with you on problems in scalable end host stacks, verification of performance, congestion control, satellite networks, and wireless networks. For master's students, our work can start as a CS8903 and expand into a project and a thesis.</p>


            <h5>FAQ</h5>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>What are the expectations?</strong><br/>
                    It's much simpler if the work is for credit. A good start will be to take one of the classes I teach and let me know that you are interested in doing research in networking after the class. That way, we can use that opportunity to get you started while working within the expectations set for the class. Afterwards, master's students can register for CS8903, which I expect you to treat it as a heavy-load graduate class. Generally, I try to avoid having students work with me for no credits. </p>
                    </li>    
                    
                    <li>
                    <p><strong>Will I be funded?</strong><br/>
                    Funding for master's and undergraduate students is limited but possible. Decisions are made on a per-case basis.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <p><strong>I am an undergraduate student in another US university, can I work with you during summer?</strong><br/>
                    Yes, please check out the <a href="https://sure.gatech.edu">Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering/Sciences (SURE) program</a>. Mention my name in your application and email me directly after you've applied.</p>
